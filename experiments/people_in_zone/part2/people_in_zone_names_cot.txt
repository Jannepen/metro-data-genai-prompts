Task: Determine the number of people inside the zone using the following data

<Data>
{data}
</Data>

Do this step by step, by going one row at a time:
1. Go through the data one row at a time.
2. For each row, read agent_id and zone_name.
3. Check if the zone_name is 'Zone_A'
4. If it is, include the agent in the zone.
5. If an agent appears multiple times in the zone, only count them once.
6. After going through the whole data, check the individuals inside the zone and confirm that they are in 'Zone_A'.

Return the result exactly in this format:

Zone A:
- Count: <number>
- People:
  - agent_id: <id>
  ...
  
Do not return the step-by-step reasoning. Just return the final result in the format above.
