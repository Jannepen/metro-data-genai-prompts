The following data records peopleâ€™s locations inside a metro station using sensors.
Your task is to determine the number of people inside a specific zone.
To do this, use the coordinates of each person and compare them to the zone limits.

The zone limits for zone A are the following:
x_axis: The x_axis value must be between 159.8 and 167.4
z_axis: The z_axis value must be between -176.5 and -171.5

Task: Determine the number of people inside the zone A using the following data

<Data>
{df_test_csv}
</Data>

Do this step by step, by going one row at a time:
1. Go through the data one row at a time.
2. For each row, read agent_id, x_axis, and z_axis.
3. Check if the coordinates are within the zone limits.
4. If they are, include the agent in the zone.
5. If an agent appears multiple times in the zone, only count them once.
6. After going through the whole data, check the individuals inside the zone and sure they really are within the zone limits.

Return the result exactly in this format:

Zone:
- Count: <number>
- People:
  - agent_id: <id>, x_axis: <value>, z_axis: <value>
  ...
  
Do not return the step-by-step reasoning. Just return the final result in the format above.
